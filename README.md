# AIM: Study of loops
# THEORY:
## Topics Covered

- while loop (condition-based iteration)
- for loop (range-based and sequence iteration)
- Loop control statements:
  - break
  - continue
- Nested loops
- Common loop patterns and problems:
  - Printing sequences
  - Factorial
  - Fibonacci series
  - Reverse a number
  - Palindrome check
  - Sum of first N numbers
  - Printing patterns / matrix traversal
  - Matrix multiplication (3×3)

## Key Programs / Demonstrations

- Basic while loop (print 0 to 5)
- Print numbers from 1 to N (user input)
- Calculate factorial using while
- Generate Fibonacci series using while
- Reverse a number using while
- Check if number/string is palindrome
- Use of break statement
- Use of continue statement (skip specific numbers)
- Print only odd numbers using continue
- Basic for loop with range()
- Print even numbers using range(start, stop, step)
- Sum of first N natural numbers
- Nested loops – printing pairs (i,j)
- Traverse and print 3×3 matrix
- Multiply two 3×3 matrices using nested loops


## Key Learnings

- `while` loop : best when number of iterations is **not known** in advance
- `for` loop : ideal when iterating over known range or sequence
- `break` : immediately exit the loop
- `continue` : skip current iteration and move to next
- Nested loops are useful for working with 2D data (matrices, patterns, tables)
- range() function is very powerful with for loops (start, stop, step)
- Loops form the backbone of repetitive tasks and algorithmic problem solving

## Conclusion

This experiment provided hands-on practice with both types of loops in Python, along with control flow statements and common algorithmic patterns. Mastering loops is essential for solving almost every programming problem involving repetition, sequences, matrices, and data processing.
